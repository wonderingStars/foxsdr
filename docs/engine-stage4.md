# Engine extraction, stage 4: the engine behind the C table - design, and what it needs first

Stage 4 of the extraction plan: the Engine exports `FoxEngineApi`, and
`gui::AppWindow` reads and writes only through it - `read_state` once a frame,
`read_spectrum` once, one `submit` a frame - enforced by building the interface
as its own CMake target that cannot see the engine headers.

**Status (2026-09-29): not started in code. Stopped here on purpose**, because
implementing the table faithfully changes who may key the transmitter and when
a control takes effect, against a specification that is only partly in this
tree. This document is the design and the list of what is missing.

## 1. What the tree already has

- **The table itself**: `third_party/foxsdr_api/foxsdr_api.h`, API 0.2 (draft),
  vendored unmodified from foxsdr-api commit 8fb6522 (third_party/foxsdr_api/
  README.md). `FoxEngineApi` has create/destroy, open_session/close_session,
  heartbeat, read_state, read_spectrum, submit, poll_results,
  subscribe/poll_events, read_audio, read_iq, read_list, get_setting,
  read_image, login/logout.
- **The state**: the engine already publishes a `FoxReceiverState` every
  frame (`core::PublishedState::rx`, stage 2) through the receiver snapshot,
  lock-free for readers; engine-stage2.md section 2 maps every field and
  lists the unfilled ones (OPEN 1-9 there).
- **The vocabulary**: every change to the receiver is already a `FoxCommand`
  (`FOXAPI_OP_*`, plus `FOXAPP_OP_*` app extensions 0x8000-0x8FFF,
  src/core/app_commands.hpp), applied by `Engine::applyCommand`.
- **The threading**: a thread-safe command queue and the engine's own
  control thread (engine-stage3.md section 10), so an in-process `submit` can
  be a queue push and the engine's pump never waits on an interface.

## 2. What is missing, exactly

1. **docs/API.md** (foxsdr-api). The header defers to it for: the command
   reference (which slots each op reads, its grant, its result's `applied[]`);
   the meaning of `value[]` per list ("Lists"); the patch document format
   (`FOXAPI_OP_PATCH_LOAD`); "Streams" (the spectrum's history, audio
   cursors); the "Transmitter" section behind THE KEY; the coverage table
   (which app feature maps to which op/list/state field, and which are
   gaps). Without it a second implementation guesses.
2. **The mock engine and its tests** (foxsdr-api `src/mock_engine`, named in
   `FoxEngineParams`). They are the reference behaviour for tickets, BUSY,
   merging of the five safer kinds, results in ticket order, "a result is
   never readable before the snapshot that shows it", and the latch
   protocol. Porting its conformance tests to run against the real engine is
   how stage 4 would prove it implements the same table.
3. **docs/TRANSPORTS.md** (for stage 5/6: the remote client library, local
   token file, keep-alive over a socket).

## 3. Decisions the owner has to make first

1. **The transmit key model.** The table's rules differ from the app's today:

   | | app today (core/transmitter.hpp) | API 0.2 (THE KEY) |
   |---|---|---|
   | local PTT | a level the window sets every frame; released by a frame without it, or a front end silent for 1 s | `TX_PTT 1` is a 2 s HOLD the interface re-asserts; `TX_PTT 0` releases now |
   | latch | one latch; the LATCH key toggles it; 60 s failsafe | owned by a PRINCIPAL; any end other than the owner's `LATCH 0` MARKS the principal until that session sends `LATCH 0`; 1 s re-arm after any end; edge-triggered key protocol (`LATCH 0` + `LATCH 1` in one batch) |
   | remote PTT | allowed while the Transmit page is open and a transmitter is open (implicit consent) | needs `TX_REMOTE_ARM 1` from a LOCAL session; lapses when it disarms, closes or goes silent |
   | keep-alive | one front-end stamp, one control stamp | per session: 1 s local, 2 s remote; only `heartbeat()` counts |
   | who holds the key | nobody in particular | per session (`TX_KEY_MINE`) |

   Implementing the table means adopting the right-hand column, which
   changes who may key and when - each rule needs a test shown red and then
   green, and core/transmitter.hpp's header rewritten to match. The owner
   should confirm the API's model is the one to ship (or that the table is
   implemented over the app's model with the differences reported as
   gaps).
2. **Frame semantics.** `read_state` once a frame and one `submit` a frame
   means every control lands one control pass later than today (a key press
   and its effect in the same frame is the app's behaviour now; stage 2
   section 6 declined to change it piecemeal and deferred it here). Accept
   the one-pass lag, or specify how the window should wait for its own
   batch.
3. **What the table has no read for.** The window draws things the table
   does not carry (from the ratchet's scan of its engine reads):
   - the plugin windows (`pluginUi_`, 40 reads): plugin UI code the window
     runs on its thread, through the plugin ABI's host API - these belong to
     the host process, not to an interface, and need a home;
   - the Patch page: the graph structure, per-node spectra
     (`patchSpectra_`), decoded pictures, the device choices (`patchPlan_`,
     `patchRadios_`, `patchCatalogue_`: ~60 reads) - `FOXAPI_OP_PATCH_LOAD`
     writes a document, nothing reads one back;
   - the store's entry details (legal notices, install-blocked reasons,
     planned updates), converters, the bias-tee key, the Airspy gain modes,
     the scope taps (`FOXAPI_CAP_SCOPE` "reduced"), the basemap and
     track-info plugin APIs, the status lines (`EngineStatusText`), the
     recorder paths and start times, the config snapshot.
   Each needs a list, a setting key, an event or an API addition - an
   upstream change to the draft (it is 0.x, and the owner may reshape it),
   not something to invent in this tree.

## 4. The plan once those are settled

1. **The engine exports the table** (`engine/fox_engine_api.cpp`,
   `foxsdr_engine_query`): create/destroy over an Engine with its control
   thread; sessions with grants and flags; `heartbeat`; `read_state` from
   the published `FoxReceiverState` (per-session fields filled per read);
   `read_spectrum` from the published spectrum; `submit`/`poll_results`
   with tickets, BUSY and the safer-command merge; capability bits only for
   what is implemented. Tested by the mock engine's conformance suite run
   against it.
2. **The transmit key model** per decision 1, behind red/green tests.
3. **Lists** (`read_list`) for the collections the window draws.
4. **The window's port**, group by group, onto one `read_state`, one
   `read_spectrum` and one `submit` a frame - with stage 3's remainder
   (engine-stage3.md section 10, item 4): the window's pump moves to the
   control thread in the same step, because the table is what makes its
   reads safe.
5. **The fence**: the interface built as its own CMake target that sees only
   `foxsdr_api.h` and app_commands.hpp, so a direct engine read no longer
   compiles; tests/test_command_path_guard.cpp's ratchet reaches zero and is
   retired.

Stage 5 (web and CAT as sessions) needs 1 and 2; stage 7 (the headless
foxsdr-engine) needs 1 and stage 5's transports to take commands from.
Stage 6 is skipped, as asked.

## 5. What the measurement run should watch, when this lands

Frame time and tune-to-audio latency (a control lands one pass later; the
pass period sets the added latency), GUI-thread stalls (the window no longer
runs engine waits in its frame - should improve), CPU at a fixed rate (one
control thread's passes added, the window's engine work removed), memory
(per-session rings and result queues). Nothing here touches the sample path.
